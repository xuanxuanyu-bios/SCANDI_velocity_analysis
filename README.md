# SCANDI_velocity_analysis

## Summary of the data

The data contains 4 samples (S1_S4). Cell type annotation has been performed. We want to performed trajectory analysis to understanding the dynamic process and differentiation pathways of cells. The following steps are conducted to to the trajectory analysis

## Step 1 - Alignment and counting using CellRanger

##Cell Ranger is a software suite provided by 10x Genomics designed to process and analyze single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data generated from their Chromium platform. It automates the workflow from raw sequencing reads to gene expression matrices and various quality control metrics.##
